## üî≠ 1. Issue: Clickable elements too close together

### Description:

Touch elements, such as buttons and navigational links, are positioned in close proximity to each other, making it difficult for mobile users to tap a desired element without accidentally tapping neighboring elements.

### Fix:

To address this issue, the following steps have been taken:

1. Reviewed the provided test page to identify buttons, links, and other touch targets.
2. Ensured that the touch targets are adequately spaced apart, allowing for an average fingertip width or sufficient space to avoid accidental taps on neighboring elements.
3. Adjusted the positioning of elements as necessary to enhance touch target accessibility on mobile devices.
4. Referenced the "Accessible Tap Targets" guidelines for best practices and additional insights.

## üíª 2. Issue: Text too small to read

### Description:

A considerable portion of the text on the page appears small in relation to the page width, leading to difficulties in reading the content on mobile devices.

### Fix:

To resolve this issue, the following approach was taken:

1. Examined the provided test page for the device to identify text elements with readability concerns.
2. Implemented a viewport specification for web pages, ensuring that the content scales properly within the viewport.
3. Adjusted font sizes across the page to ensure optimal visibility on mobile screens, considering the recommended best practices for font size.
4. Ensured that all text remains legible without compromising the attractiveness and overall design of the page.
5. Referred to the "Best Practices for Font Size" guidelines for insights on establishing an appropriate font size range.

Note: While the best practice recommends a minimum font size of 12px, the existing font sizes on the test were already set at a minimum of 16px. Modifying the font size beyond 16px may adversely impact the aesthetics and visual appeal of the page.
